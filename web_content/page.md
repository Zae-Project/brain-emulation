Brain Emulation Project
An exploration on how to simulate brains in software. It starts with understanding how neurons work, then building up to more complex networks. The long term goal is mind uploading and preserving human consciousness in digital form.

What is done.
Right now, just a JavaScript simulator that shows how 120 neurons connect and fire. You can watch signals move through the network and adjust parameters to see what happens.
It's not fancy, but it's real neural computation running on your computer.
The Bigger Picture
Our biological brains won't last forever. Bodies age, neurons die, memories fade. But if we understand how consciousness works at the neural level, maybe we can preserve it digitally.
This is the immortality problem, not living forever in flesh, but continuing to exist beyond biological death.

Current Progress
What Works:

120-neuron network with realistic spiking behavior

Real-time 3D visualization

12 lessons covering basics to brain emulation theory

Network plasticity and simple learning

What We're Learning:

How individual neurons accumulate voltage

How synaptic connections strengthen and weaken

How networks form clusters and process information

How memories might form and persist

Next Steps:
Short term: Scale to thousands of neurons with better biological accuracy
Medium term: Model brain regions like cortical columns and memory systems
Long term: Figure out how to map individual human neural patterns
We don't know if this will work. Consciousness might be more than just neural firing patterns. But every simulation teaches us something new about how minds work.

Why Start Here:
You can't upload a mind without understanding what a mind actually is. These simple neuron models are where that understanding begins.
The simulator runs locally. Clone the repo, open the HTML file, and start experimenting. No installation needed.

The Reality
Mind uploading is hard. Maybe impossibly hard. But the only way to find out is to start building and learning.
Just one neuron at a time, one connection at a time, one lesson at a time.
If we eventually crack the code of consciousness, great. If we just learn a lot about how brains work along the way, that's valuable too.

Download it. Try the lessons. See how neural networks actually behave. Contribute if you want to help figure out digital consciousness.
No promises, just honest exploration of what might be possible.

"Real neurons. Real learning. Real shot at digital immortality."
