# mindtransfer.me | Human cognition, simulated

Mindtransfer.me is an open, research led effort to map living neurobiology into interactive software. Our goal is to make whole brain emulation and mind transfer a measurable engineering problem, not a slogan. We do that by combining peer reviewed data, auditable models, and an explorable interface that anyone can launch in a browser.

## What we are building

**Mind uploading through evidence.** We are working spiking neural network environment that mirrors known brain architecture. Each release expands our ability to capture the computations that underwrite human memory, perception, and identity. When mind transfer becomes technically possible, it will rest on the kind of transparent, verifiable models we are assembling today.

## Current capabilities

### Interactive brain emulation playground

- Realtime 3D spiking neural network visualiser with orbit controls and smooth zooming.
- Dynamic inspector that surfaces cluster context, neuron taxonomy, excitatory/inhibitory balance, and live voltage traces.
- Cinematic yet accessible visual language: neuron glyphs convey cell type, warm desert palette highlights region provenance, and status telemetry keeps orientation effortless.

### Scientifically grounded region templates

- Curated human brain maps sourced from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, the EBRAINS Julich-Brain project, and the BrainGlobe atlas ecosystem.
- Layer-specific motor cortex, somatosensory barrel fields, occipital visual streams, and mediodorsal thalamic loops—each with realistic neuron ratios (≈80% excitatory, 20% inhibitory), delays, and projection targets backed by published literature.
- Import/export pipeline for JSON templates so researchers can test their own atlases without rewriting code.

### Guided documentation for every concept

- Twelve documentation chapters replace the old “lessons,” covering everything from the project vision to advanced configuration and troubleshooting.
- Plain-language explanations ensure newcomers understand what mind uploading demands, while contributors get the detail needed to extend the simulator responsibly.

## Scientific foundation

- **Neuron diversity:** Taxonomy aligns with transcriptomic and morphological datasets (pyramidal, basket, chandelier, medium spiny, thalamic relay, and more), each mapped to distinct visual glyphs.
- **Connectivity realism:** Atlas templates respect reported projection probabilities, including dense CA3 recurrence and corticothalamic feedback. Probability sliders apply scaling factors without breaking biological proportions.
- **Data provenance:** Every preset cites its source atlas, release date, and key references directly in the UI. Import scripts encourage researchers to attach DOIs and methodology notes.

## In active development

- Automated atlas ingestion script to convert Allen and siibra data into ready-to-run templates.
- Expanded analytic overlays (frequency spectra, spike synchrony) to measure mind-relevant signatures like oscillations and global workspace dynamics.
- Preservation tooling: versioned exports, integrity checks, and reproducible manifests to support long-term mind transfer archives.

## Why mindtransfer.me matters

Mind uploading and whole brain emulation demand rigorous models, not marketing hype. By shipping a transparent simulator today—complete with verifiable data, intuitive controls, and documented assumptions—we advance the field toward a future where consciousness can be studied, preserved, and perhaps migrated with scientific confidence.

> “Real neurons. Real research. A clear path toward digital continuity.”
